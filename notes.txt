notes on adts


good forms of recursion

catamorphisms:

f _ _ _ _ x = blah blah only call f on subparts of x


anamorphism:

f _ = CoConstr (anything here including f calls)


what can values be?

AdtDistr VarId [[GraphValue]]


what if a case is applied to AdtDistr?
- expand every case, using the GraphValues in the AdtDistr as the values
- at the end, a "select only this one" factor

but what if the returned values themselves are adts?
then hook up factors of case return values to the result
